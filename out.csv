Added: Unpleasant, but well worth the discomfort. Clings to skin with a subtle grip, and  spreads itself out over a human body if given the chance. Living ritual implements like this have been rumored for years, but this was my first chance to study one.
Added: A wide silk ribbon, such as you might use for a medal. There is a faint pattern woven into the silk, showing birds in flight. It seems to be ancestor silk, but I haven't seen its like.
Added: Interesting. This appears to be the hook or ring that secured an amulet to its chain. As you can see, it's shaped like an eagle's talon. Altmeri, I think. But I don't recognize the metal.
Added: Good metal, this.  The Ayleids were masters of meteoric iron and crafted many fine blades from it. But I do not think this was part of a weapon. What is the significance of these interlocking rings?
Added: Here we see an example of Ayleid jewelcraft at its best. This is the mounting for a large stone, unfortunately missing. If meteoric iron was the servant of the Ayleids, palladium was their delight.
Added: Judging by its size and cut, this jewel was the center of a large piece such as a medallion or a crown. Its innate magicka gives it that striking color. Could it be an Ayleid welkynd crystal?
Added: That's because this ribbon is an extraordinarily well preserved example of ancient silk. With the proper baths and treatments, ancestor silk can last centuries. I don't recognize the pattern, though.
Added: It's palladium. A rare ore much-loved by Ayleid jewelers for its luster and durability. The ancient High Elves weren't the only ones who admired birds.
Added: The three-ring loop is a triquetra. It symbolizes land, sea, and sky. This one appears to be an amulet or medallion of great age, although it's missing the central stone.
Added: Note how the prongs intended to secure the missing stone are cleverly disguised as delicate wings. I imagine this was part of a pendant or amulet, but we have neither the base nor the jewel.
Added: A welkynd stone? How exciting! It's said that each welkynd came from a star that fell from the sky. Imagine that--a piece of Aetherius in your hand! The Ayleids greatly prized them.
Added: It's older than you think. In fact, this is not Nibenese silk at all. The bird pattern is Ayleid, from the early First Era. Everyone knows the Heartland Elves were the first to weave ancestor silk.
Added: Oh! Of course. I should have put two and two together. Yes, the Ayleids often used feather and talon motifs in their work. I'd love to see the rest of this medallion; it must have been impressive.
Added: I've seen this triquetra  before, in the ruins of Nenalata. It was the emblem of the royal house. This medallion might have been looted from a king's tomb when the Alessian Order razed the city.
Added: Ah. The so-called "feathered jewels" were associated with House Dynar, the royal line of long-lost Nenalata. I always wondered what exactly the ancient scribes meant by that turn of phrase.
Added: Aetherial gems were potent tools in the hands of a mage. This one likely belonged to an Ayleid sorcerer-king. I recall an ancient text that described the "blue gem" of a king of Nenalata. Could this be one such gem?
Added: Snushulag's Promise
Added: This may be the last time I can contribute to the bookshelves, and I may not even get that honor. Woe is the name of Bikkus-Muz whose last known addition was a critique of fried tentacle soup!\n\nI almost can't believe what my eyes tell me is occurring at this very moment. The books, they're falling open on their own. This alone would not be worth note—as books in Apocrypha behave autonomously at most times—but I can see the ink rising off their pages. The ink seemed legible at first, but then it flowed together until it coalesced into a ball. Now, it appears as though a tomeshell were leaving its book, but there's no tomeshell in sight. The ball of ink stretches and distorts. It's moving, rising higher over the book and begins shooting streams of dark liquid in every direction. They pool on the ground, not moving for a moment and then taking shape.\n\nFate's pages! The shapes—silhouettes, whatever you call them—are fully formed creatures. Mortals and monsters of ink. They can move independently. The darkness fades from their skin. The book manifested creatures. I'm witnessing words walking.\n\nI'm too far away to hear if they speak or make noise of any sort and for that I'm glad. The creatures feel sinister. They're wrong, everything about this is wrong. I thought I would be joyous at the prospect of words literally coming to life. These dry history texts could read themselves to me which would be a lot less strenuous on the eyes, but instead I'm rooted to my hiding place in fear. \n\nIf these creatures find me, I don't know what they will do. Now that what I know has changed in front of my eyes, I fear the unknown more greatly than I fear anything else. A simple death would be a blessing. It would stop this fear from consuming me whole.
Added: All right, which one of you moth-brained, flea infested book worms came all the way to Apocrypha to deface the Abyssal Cephaliarch's property? Leaving annotations in the margins, have you no respect? No decency? It would be one thing if you said anything remotely relevant to the text, but since you haven't then there really is no point to this sacrilege. \n\nBy my count, the defacements include: 35 separate works which contain underlined passages, 157 which contain circled words, 8 where words are scratched out to the point of illegibility, and 1256 books in total which carry your scrawl in the margins—495 tomes in which you've just written the word 'liar' repeatedly. I'm not sure who taught you any of the tenants of respect, but you clearly missed more than a few of those lessons you ungrateful squidling.\n\nIf I ever have the good fortune to track you down, know that I will ensure that you can never hold another writing implement again. You have lost the right. You've desecrated the library of Apocrypha. Hope the lurkers find you before I do. \n\n-	Cipher Snushulag
Added: For being just a section of Apocrypha's great library, the Endless Archive has always been a nebulous labyrinth. A conduit for confusion and a trap for those whose orienteering has not adapted to the mercurial nature of this realm. While the disparate locations within the archive's vast and sprawling space appear very different from one another, the pathways between them are often unknowingly traversed, making backtracking to the entrance nigh on impossible at the best of times. \n\nDuring their last rift-visit, the Scribes of Mora attempted to map the twisting array of the Endless Archive. They made some progress towards understanding the internal logic of this place, but their rift began to close before they could map it in its entirety. I fear there may be some of their number still wandering the corridors and hallways within.\n\nAll of this is the say that this place has always been formidable. Lately it feels as if the archive is more chaotic than ever. I took the Scribes' map with me on my most recent excursion into the depths. None of the gateways between the archive's myriad sections aligned with the maps—which has never happened before. This confirms my anecdotal suspicions. To say that the locations in within the Endless Archive are rearranging themselves would be an overstatement, but that may be what is occurring to some degree. More accurately, I believe there are metaphysical doors creating new links between these locations. More metaphorically speaking, the doors connecting these archive wings together are opening and locking in ways. More than that, it's infested with carpenters who insist on changing the blueprint or building new annexes! In short, there is something strange afoot here and I intend to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n\n**\n\nMy journey today was purely academic. While I confirmed the existence of the archive's ever-shifting nature, I was also able to devise tactics with which to combat the mercurial halls. Thanks to the Index and my filer companions, I am able to traverse through the hallways with only slightly more annoyance than I otherwise would have. This is no great victory, but at least I can return to my primary objective of researching more about this confusing place.\n\nToday, I searched for The Elusive Traveler a book of some small historical note by Carnius Missonnie—an author of similar unimportance. All told, I didn't expect this particular volume to shed any light on the question of what the Endless Archive is, but quite notably, it was missing from the Index's records. \n\nFiler Jun located the book in a wing by the bridges and I was able to skim its pages before beginning my long walk back. The book appears to be in a similar vein as the majority that fill this area. It is a moderately embellished historical account of the Vestige's travels. Many of the books contained within the Endless Archive fall under the category of historical accounts of more recent events. \n\nNow, many of the accounts agree on the basic order of the events they recount, though they do tend to disagree on the specifics. For example, one book will say that the Dragon Joorahmaar breathed fire while others insist that clouds of poisonous smoke erupted from his mouth. Given the differences in these accounts, the truth remains somewhat blurred. \n\nI am coming into a hypothesis of my own though. I mentioned how the Index's catalog was suspiciously devoid of information regarding The Elusive Traveler. This is not the first tome which suspiciously lacked information which I have stumbled across. Without hunting down another book to confirm my theory, I will write it here and save the expedition for another day. My theory is this, the books in the catalog which have limited information deal with the Vestage's history. If my theory is correct, what is the significance of this fact? And how can I find all the books? There must be a way to enter them all into the record.\n\n**\n\nI stumbled into what I can only describe as a strange vision or a pocket realm or something far stranger that I cannot force my mind to rationalize. \n\nI journeyed into the Endless Archive, once again in search of a book to further my research into this place's history. But this time, when I reached the end of one section, two portals appeared instead of one. Now, I have a healthy appreciation of the threats of this place. I know what dangers lie in straying from the known paths—especially now. So, I cannot rightly say what drove me to step into the second portal. From there my experience became indescribably strange. \n\nMy eyes didn't fit in my skull, they still ache from being stretched beyond their usual parameters. And my teeth feel entirely too small. I remember a nauseating amount of sugar, the sweetness sticks to everything. When I came to my senses retching on the ground with just enough wherewithal to ensure that I didn't soil a priceless folio, the sweetness followed me. It's still here, like a sort of honey toffee clinging to the back of my mouth. My legs and arms ache as well. As if I've run a great distance, but I was back on the same platform where I left. \n\nI will turn to bed after finishing this account. Maybe whatever I experienced will make more sense after a rest.\n\n**
Added: In this book of Obscure Killers from the North, we've discussed the Botgelvi Throat-cutter, Lyngerd the Poisoner, and the Nameless Nord. Now we've come to the most mysterious killer of them all. Some of my fellow scholars question if this man existed despite the plethora of accounts. I will concede that while folklore and superstition are not the most accurate—often shifting to account for new and greater beliefs. Still, the very nexus of lore that we have discussing this killer does lead me to believe that all the stories, rhymes, and ditties have some basis in truth. \n\nRegardless of the actual historical basis for this killer, the effect he had on the cultural practices of northern Skyrim are clear. It is said that children hid under their beds on the darkest nights of the season in the hopes that they would be spared. And that all adults fell silent under the threat of offending the wrong person and facing the consequences. I, Florenot Epinard, introduce to you—my audience— The Butcher of Morthal.\n\nLittle is known about this illusive character. He appears sporadically in tales dating back to 2E 248 and more frequently in children's songs from the same time. Throughout history, butchers are a source of fear and folklore. Perhaps this fascination stems from the profession's familiarity with the dead or anatomy. Whatever the cause, there are facts which cannot be ignored about the supposed Butcher of Morthal.\n\nHe's a dastardly man, Butcher Haefal\nProtective of his sweetrolls.\nHis steel is colder than old Morthal\nTo carve you up for frost trolls.\n\nHe'll call you goat while he slits your throat\nThe dastardly butcher, Haefal.\nWhen the river thaws then it's down you'll float\nNever again seen in Mortal.\n—	Children's skipping rhyme circa 2E 275\n\nThe disturbing details of the above excerpt point to the very real reality of the long winter in 2E 248. As many as a dozen families disappeared almost overnight, which led to paranoia and worry among the survivors of Morthal. The missing Nords were never found, though their doors were left open almost as if someone came into their homes in the middle of the night and dragged them away.\n\nOur records from the period the tale of the Butcher of Morthal bear no mention of the name Haefal, or this mystery would be solved before it began. It's likely that name was attributed to the murders at the creation of the children's rhyme. \n\nMost scholars at the time, and my contemporaries, assume that the missing villagers are the result of strategic goblin attacks which were frequent at that time. But, for a moment, let us consider that the Butcher of Mortal was real. Who was he?\n\nMorthal is not a large village, so it is unlikely that there was a formal butcher. More realistically, every family had experience turning raw game into cookable ingredients. If there was one specialized craftsman, then it would be far easier to discover who the killer was. Or indeed if the killer was a skilled butcher at all. Still, there is a distinct possibility that butcher referred to the gruesome fate of the victims and not a profession at all. \n\nAs for temperament, he would have to be highly reactive. The children's rhymes suggest that the killer exacted revenge over a breach of the code of conduct: eating his sweetrolls. If this is the case, that something as small as a missing dessert would result in brutal murder, then the killer would have to be more than just protective of sweetrolls. The protection would be fanatical, almost religious. But a religious devotion to a delectable dessert is straying too far from the source material to be a feasible theory and so I will set it aside.   \n\nIt may be worth noting that many sources about Butcher Haefal include references to goats. Perhaps this was a way of announcing his intent to his victims? There was a theory that multiple herds of goats also went missing around this same year, though the records of herd sizes are more sparse than usual. I find that explanation difficult to believe, but for the sake of academic integrity, I resolved to include the information here.\n\nWith such a secretive and potentially fictionalized killer, it's difficult to tell when the deaths stopped. In truth, it's impossible to tell if the killer was ever actually caught. The other examples in this book have a more definitive resolution. Which is a boon for historians, and the populace as a whole, but the Butcher of Morthal's legend has never fully died. \n\nIf you travel to Morthal and ask a village elder, they'll likely know who the Butcher was. They may even regale you with tales of how the butcher haunted their nightmares as a child. Which just goes to show the hold that the butcher has upon the people of Morthal. By existing in folklore and in popular memory, he never really died. The Butcher of Morthal can never truly be killed or defeated.
Added: Few Daedra have ever been fully bound by the power of the paleonymic or any nymic, though famous examples do exist. This is because they rarely record their nymics anywhere or allow them to become known either by mortals or by other Daedra. This is the extrapolations added to the history of Archmagister Mavon Ules as evidenced by the recent discovery of Mysissa's pilfered notebooks. Direct quotes are taken from the source material, extrapolations are the product of myself, Nardhil Arethan.\n\nIn the year 2E 210 Magister Mavon Ules performed a spell of reportedly immense power which solidified his position as the Archmagister for almost a decade before it was stripped from him by Magister Varona Githrano. The spell summoned one of the lesser Daedra and bound it to Magister Mavon's service. Such spells were previously used to bind imps and scamps, but none had ever been attempted with the Skaafin or similarly ranked Daedra. This is what made the now Archmagister Mavon's spell so unique and powerful. \n\nArchmagister Mavon, notoriously kept few records. This makes him widely unpopular both to the magisters who lived at this time —and who wanted to steal his magical secrets for their own benefit—as well as among historians—who seek to preserve the past via written accounts. The Skaafin, Mysissa, bound by his spell, on the other hand, was prolific and detailed in her hatred of Mavon. She detailed her life with Magister Mavon, though in reviewing the documents, there is nothing useful for other mages. Most of the many books Mysissa wrote in contained the insults and threats expected of a Daedra in her situation. Though one passage does suggest how Archmagster Mavon completed the spell which trapped Mysissa. \n\n"If he'd won my name through trickery of guile like a truly Regretful creature, then this would be fine. But no, he shuned Nycot and stumbled across it. The bafoonish mortal thinks he's some some of mage-godling? Ha! There's more magic in a dog's tail! When he dies, I will call the bugs and crawlers of this realm to feast on his unworthy corpse!"\n\nThe name that Mysissa refers to, could be her paleonymic. If Archmasgister Mavon somehow found a daedra's paleonymic then the mystery of his Skaafin servant is less mysterious than previously thought. This also explains why Mysissa never wrote down any of Mavon's secrets, as it's likely that the spell binding her to his service forbade any direct sabotaging of his magical pursuits. Which is just as well for Mysissa, as this means there's no record of her paleonymic, nor of the ritual which bound her fully to Magister Mavon's service. \n\nMysissa's existence and binding to Magister Mavon where heretofore the subject of much speculation. Other magisters around Archmagister Mavon's ascension noted that his magical power gained a significant and sudden boost while non among their number were impacted. He seemed more knowledgeable in the matters of Oblivion, to the point where some speculated that he made a pact with a Daedra of some sort. But, no one guessed that he has a Skaafin assisting him or advising him. \n\nNow knowing what we do, with several tomes dedicated to elaborate plans to dispose of Archmagister Mavon, I suspect that Mysissa had a hand in Archmagister Mavon's downfall. Where previously it is thought that Magister Dubere Dilmyn infiltrated into Mavon's tower under the promise of companionship and a new alchemical ingredient. The current theory is that Mysissa distracted her master so that he never fully unlocked the door (Murder plan number 534). \n\nAfter Archmagister Mavon's disappearance, for he did disappear—potentially eaten by the crawlers as Mysissa promised—not much is known of Mysissa or what happened to her. I suspect that after this time spent in Archmagister Mavon's service, that she quickly disposed of any evidence of her paleonymic and left this plane. Which would explain why we have no records of the spell or notes of Archmagister Mavon's contributions to spellcrafting of any sort. \n\nI would say that Archmagister Mavon's demise is a cautionary tale against using nymics to trap and control Daedra, but the true and factual matter of the documents found about Mysissa is that not enough is known. Still as Mysissa wrote, "do not meddle in affairs you cannot control. The power of names, less so."
Added: In the year 2E 87 the Knights of the Silver Rose launched a perilous campaign against a Xivilai clan who sought to invade Borderwatch. While little is known about how they intercepted the Xivilai's plans or became aware of it, their methods were swift and effective. Accounts written by Collatinus Antias, a member of the order describe the Knight's assault tactics.\n\n"We stole through the night, creeping across the hills and through the grasses with stealth which surprised even our seasoned Knight commander. Our formations were well-organized, with nary a space for weakness or fault. When the battle finally commenced, our attack shocked the battle-hardened Daedra so much that their surprise allowed us the upper hand. We struck fiercely and true. After all these months of training, the battle took little longer than a night. The Xivilai are used to fighting as individuals, gaining their own glory through their battle skills. This was their eventual downfall since their lack of formation could find no bearing against our well-practiced tactics. We pent the following days giving praise and thanks to the mother of the Rose who saw us through the battle. In her name, we succeed. In her name, our lands are safe from corruption. And, in her name, we act. \n\nBlessed be Azura, who is the guiding strength behind our attack."

Added: 2E 304, Abecean Sea.\n\nAt the rate at which my crew is shrinking, I doubt anything of our accursed and ill-fated voyage will survive beyond this record. Tu' whacca, give us the strength to avoid it. \n\nFor all the days I neglected to write the happenings on my ship, I'll recount the major events.\n\nWe set off from Summerset and headed west across the waters. A fierce wind kept our sails filled and our course calculations has us making landfall in Khefrem a week early. The crew rejoiced, for our time at sea was long and everyone was eager to sail in familiar waters once again. The sun was high, and no other sails or storms were visible from the crow's-nest. Everything was calm and idyllic. Tava looked upon us favorably. Or so we thought.\n\nWe awoke one morning to find ourselves trapped in the clear eye of a storm. A league on either side, was dark clouds and troubled seas. But we rested in windless pocket of clear skies and calm waters. At first, we thought it was a Sea Elf raid. The crew spent three nights armed and prepared for battle. They slept in shifts and got little rest at that. When no ships broke the storm clouds and no wind filled our sail, we thought of the Daedra and wondered if we somehow drew the attention of their frightful number. Still, with our stores emptying every day, we could not wait in the water to starve. I ordered all rested hands to put oar to water. If the winds would not propel us to Stros M'kai, we would do it ourselves. That was my mistake.\n\nThe moment the first oar breached the still ocean waters the sea grew violent. It rippled and roiled with the bodies of a hundred sea adders. Their thick serpentine bodies lashed out and leaped onto the deck. Those with oars in the hands suffered the greatest, for the oars were too long to be used in combat. And those below deck, resting after their shifts of watching for Sea Elves had little time to gather themselves before the adders found the stairs. Somehow, we managed to slay the adders, but it was with heavy losses. The waters were still once more, and the Boson ordered a day of rest to tend to and care for those who remained on this side of the Far Shores.\n\nThe night was filled with the song of pain from below deck and rest was sparse. Still, the morning broke with clouded skies and a great cheer arose. The sun rose in the sky and the winds rose with it. Finally, doldrum we were caught in dissipated and the sails dragged what remained of my battered crew from those accursed waters.\n\nI thought that would be the end of our troubles, but while the wind returned, the storms did not dissipate. We sailed into their midst and, which a sizably smaller crew, we set out to battle the worst squall I have been unlucky enough to see. \n\nTwo experienced sailors pushed overboard by the arms of imps who careened out from the clouds. We lost their cries below the waves as we struggled to defend ourselves against tempest and imp. The call to arms erupted from all sides as the imps fell on us and my daring crew protected their stations and somehow kept the ship to rights before the imps fell back. \n\nWe cheered and cursed the clouds around us with equal fervor, doing our best to concentrate on battling the winds and not look about for more attackers. None came, that we saw, but the storm had worse for us in mind. When we least expected it, the lightning fell. Circular and swirling, unlike any I ever encountered. The crew let out a horrid cry as they saw great, hulking figures before us. Creatures of stone and storm who hurled tremendous energy at our vessel. \n\nStill, we had no way to avoid them. My ship was quick, but she can't outrun the wind. Her deck is sleek, but she can't turn from lightning. We fought to keep her from tearing herself apart, there was nothing more we could do. And so, my brave crew, half of the sailors who remained, stood at their posts and performed their duties until such time as the lightning drained the life from their arms. \n\nI was the worst captain in seas. In two days, I'd lost over half of my crew to unforeseen creatures. Each time we were attacked, I rushed to defend my crew, and each time I could do nothing. I do not know how we escaped the atronachs. I could not tell you where we sailed nor how. It was luck alone. Tu'whacca blessed their passing and cursed ours for our journey is not yet over.\n\nThe distance between our ship and the safety of Summerset feels insurmountable. Our journey is doomed by the sea and the sky. Enemies spring from the waters we must travel and even now my beloved crew succumbs to the pain of the past few days. \n\nI know not how these accounts of our sorry may be remembered, but I know they will survive us. If, by some blessing from the gods, we survive. I will renounce the waters I once loved. They have turned against me. May Tava see us home or end us quickly.
Added: By the order of Knightmaster Alyxe Justal and the edict of 1E 2907, we are hereby mandated to clear the Windweaper's Grove of all forms of wildlife both violent and benevolent. \n\nFrom this day forth, no sort of tree-life, lurchers, Graft-root beings, insects or squirrels will stifle our site of construction. For that is the cause of this edict. Where the Windweaper's grove now stands, is being consigned to the flow of progress and civilization. Knightmaster Alyxe Justal commissioned the construction of a temple of Arkay, in honor of the sacred grove protected by the spriggans, currently in residence there, as well as new barracks for the ever-growing militia protecting our great town.\n\nIn the name of Zenithar, may our work be productive and our toil not without merit.\nMay Arkay accept our temple, constructed in his name. \nAnd, most importantly, may Akatosh allow our work to pass quickly.
Added: In sorting through my thoughts regarding the Knights of the Silver Rose and all that transpired that day, I came down to one sorry revelation: that all, no matter how upstanding, can fall to the shadows beyond Azura.\n\nI do not want to believe what my eyes saw. I do not want to acknowledge that the knights I so admired could become those … fiends. I do not want to say that the Knights who sought to protect would turn on those they guarded. But all these things are true. \n\nWhether those creatures who once stood as a safeguard against Oblivion retained a fragment of their uncorrupted selves is beyond my understanding. I hope not. I hope they didn't have a small voice screaming inside them that this was wrong. I hope that whatever part of Oblivion changed them took the last vestiges of memory from their minds. They certainly acted like it. \n\nLet what occurred be a sign to all who seek to contain the elements of Oblivion. It is a force that cannot be held by mortals. \n\nI will pray to Azura at dusk and ask her to look out on the magics of Oblivion. Maybe one as powerful as a Daedric Prince can better stand against the fate I have seen.\n\n- Weylin
Added: As written by Girara the Undying. \n\nDepending on your magical experience and talent, there are some different classifications of material for a novice necromancer to work with. In order to raise your own army and conquer your enemies, you must first understand these materials. After all, it is a rule of magic that no one can fully control that which they do not understand. \n\nGhosts\nMagic is a fickle thing, not tied to many of the physical restrictions of this world. Because of this, it is often easiest for novices to command a similarly incorporeal material at the start of their studies. The spirits of the undead exist throughout Tamriel, though they do not always have the energy to manifest. Which is where the necromantic arts present their clear and obvious uses. Simply concentrate your power in a location and the odds are a ghost will form. \n\nSkeletons\nAs the basic soldiers in any competition necromancer's army, skeletons are little more than a structure held together with magic. Little effort is needed in order to raise them, and the requisite bones can even be carried around in a bag when you do not need them.  \n\nZombies\nSkeletons are simple creatures, easy to conjure and command. Zombies are an entirely different matter. Their flesh retains the memories of their old self and must be made to forget before they can be raised. Rituals and rites as well as a change in scenery so much to confuse the flesh and strip it of its former identity. If done successfully, the corpse of your choosing will achieve a sort of stasis and do your bidding with ease. \n\nWraiths\nUnlike the other materials, wraiths are spirits governed by strong emotions. In order to create and command a wraith, you must learn how to twist a spirit into its darkest components. Allow the anger and rage of a life cut short to govern the spirit's form as you raise it. If you master the rase of the dead, you will command it with ease.\n\nLiches\nYou cannot control these spirits. Do not even attempt to command them through magic. Liches have used necromancy to ascend to a state of undeath. They are masters of the dark rituals and necromancers of the highest power.

Removed: This may be the last time I can contribute to the bookshelves, and I may not even get that honor. Woe is the name of Bikkus-Muz, whose last known literary addition was a critique of fried tentacle soup!\n\nI almost can't believe what my eyes tell me is occurring at this very moment. The books, they're falling open on their own. This alone would not be worth noting—as books in Apocrypha behave autonomously most of the time—but I can see the ink rising off their pages. The ink seemed legible at first, but then it flowed together until it coalesced into a ball. Now it appears as though a tomeshell were leaving its book, but there's no tomeshell in sight. The ball of ink stretches and distorts. It's moving, rising higher over the book, shooting streams of dark liquid in every direction. They pool on the ground, not moving for a moment before taking shape.\n\nFate's pages! The shapes—silhouettes, whatever you call them—appear as fully formed creatures. Mortals and monsters of ink. They can move independently. The darkness fades from their skin. The book manifested creatures. I'm witnessing words walking.\n\nI'm too far away to hear if they speak or make noise of any sort, and for that I'm glad. The creatures feel sinister. They're wrong. Everything about this is wrong. I thought I would be joyous at the prospect of words literally coming to life. These dry history texts could read themselves to me, which would be a lot less strenuous on the eyes, but instead I'm rooted to my hiding place in fear. \n\nIf these creatures find me, I don't know what they will do. Now that what I know has changed in front of my eyes, I fear the unknown more greatly than I fear anything else. A simple death would be a blessing. It would stop this fear from consuming me whole.
Removed: All right, which one of you moth-brained, flea infested book worms came all the way to Apocrypha to deface the Abyssal Cephaliarch's property? Leaving annotations in the margins, have you no respect? No decency? It would be one thing if you said anything remotely relevant to the text, but since you haven't then there really is no point to this sacrilege. \n\nBy my count, the defacements include: 35 separate works which contain underlined passages, 157 which contain circled words, 8 where words are scratched out to the point of illegibility, and 1256 books in total which carry your scrawl in the margins—495 tomes in which you've just written the word liar repeatedly. I'm not sure who taught you any of the tenants of respect, but you clearly missed more than a few of those lessons, you ungrateful squidling.\n\nIf I ever have the good fortune to track you down, know that I will ensure that you can never hold another writing implement again. You have lost the right. You've desecrated the library of Apocrypha. Hope that the lurkers find you before I do. \n\nCipher Snushalarg
Removed: For being just a section of Apocrypha's great library, the Endless Archive has always been a nebulous labyrinth. A conduit for confusion and a trap for those whose orienteering has not adapted to the mercurial nature of this realm. While the disparate locations within the archive's vast and sprawling space appear very different from one another, the pathways between them are often unknowingly traversed, making backtracking to the entrance nigh on impossible at the best of times. \n\nDuring their last rift-visit, the Scribes of Mora attempted to map the twisting array of the Endless Archive. They made some progress toward understanding the internal logic of this place, but their rift began to close before they could map it in its entirety. I fear there may be some of their number still wandering the corridors and hallways within.\n\nAll of this is to say that this place has always been formidable. Lately it feels as if the archive is more chaotic than ever. I took the Scribes' map with me on my most recent excursion into the depths. None of the gateways between the archive's myriad sections aligned with the maps—which has never happened before. This confirms my anecdotal suspicions. To say that the locations within the Endless Archive are rearranging themselves would be an overstatement, but that may be what is occurring to some degree. More accurately, I believe there are metaphysical doors creating new links between these locations. More metaphorically speaking, the doors connecting these archive wings are opening and locking randomly. More than that, it's infested with carpenters who insist on changing the blueprint or building new annexes! In short, there is something strange afoot here and I intend to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n\n* * *\n\nMy journey today was purely academic. While I confirmed the existence of the archive's ever-shifting nature, I was also able to devise tactics with which to combat the mercurial halls. Thanks to the Index and my filer companions, I am able to traverse through the hallways with only slightly more annoyance than I otherwise would have. This is no great victory, but at least I can return to my primary objective of researching more about this confusing place.\n\nToday, I searched for The Elusive Traveler, a book of some small historical note by Carnius Missonnie—an author of similar unimportance. All told, I didn't expect this particular volume to shed any light on the question of what the Endless Archive is, but quite notably, it was missing from the Index's records. \n\nFiler Jun located the book in a wing by the bridges and I was able to skim its pages before beginning my long walk back. The book appears to be in a similar vein as the majority that fill this area. It is a moderately embellished historical account of the Vestige's travels. Many of the books contained within the Endless Archive fall under the category of historical accounts of more recent events. \n\nNow, many of the accounts agree on the basic order of the events they recount, though they do tend to disagree on the specifics. For example, one book will say that the Dragon Joorahmaar breathed fire while others insist that clouds of poisonous smoke erupted from his mouth. Given the differences in these accounts, the truth remains somewhat blurred. \n\nI am coming into a hypothesis of my own though. I mentioned how the Index's catalog was suspiciously devoid of information regarding The Elusive Traveler. This is not the first tome which lacked information that I have stumbled across. Without hunting down another book to confirm my theory, I will write it here and save the expedition for another day. My theory is this—the books in the catalog which have limited information available in the index deal with the Vestige's history. If my theory proves correct, what is the significance of this fact? And how can I find all the books? There must be a way to enter them all into the record.\n\n* * *\n\nI stumbled into what I can only describe as a vision or a pocket realm or something far stranger that I cannot force my mind to rationalize. \n\nI journeyed into the Endless Archive, once again in search of a book to further my research into this place's history. But this time, when I reached the end of one section, two portals appeared instead of one. Now, I have a healthy appreciation of the threats of this place. I know what dangers lie in straying from the known paths—especially now. So, I cannot rightly say what drove me to step into the second portal. From there my experience became indescribably strange. \n\nMy eyes didn't fit in my skull. They still ache from being stretched beyond their usual parameters. And my teeth feel entirely too small. I remember a nauseating amount of sugar, the sweetness sticks to everything. When I came to my senses, retching on the ground with just enough wherewithal to ensure that I didn't soil a priceless folio, the sweetness followed me. It's still here, like a sort of honey toffee clinging to the back of my mouth. My legs and arms ache as well. As if I've run a great distance, but I was back on the same platform from which I left. \n\nI will turn to bed after finishing this account. Maybe whatever I experienced will make more sense after a long rest.
Removed: By Florenot Epinard\n\nIn this book, we've discussed the Botgelvi Throat-Cutter, Lyngerd the Poisoner, and the Nameless Nord. Now we've come to the most mysterious killer of them all. Some of my fellow scholars question if this person actually existed despite the plethora of accounts. I will concede that while folklore and superstition are not the most accurate references, often shifting to account for new and greater beliefs, they usually contain at least some kernel of truth. Still, the very nexus of lore that discusses this killer leads me to believe that all the stories, rhymes, and ditties reveal events that happened. \n\nRegardless of the actual historical basis for this killer, the effect he had on the cultural practices of northern Skyrim are clear. It is said that children hid under their beds on the darkest nights of the season in the hopes that they would be spared. And that all adults fell silent under the threat of offending the wrong person and facing the consequences. Allow me to introduce to you, dear reader, the Butcher of Morthal.\n\nLittle is known about this illusive character. He appears sporadically in tales dating back to 2E 248 and more frequently in children's songs from the same period. Throughout history, butchers have served as a source of fear and folklore. Perhaps this fascination stems from the profession's familiarity with the dead and anatomy. Whatever the cause, there are facts which cannot be ignored about the supposed Butcher of Morthal.\n\nHe's a dastardly man, Butcher Haefal\nProtective of his sweetrolls.\nHis steel is colder than old Morthal\nTo carve you up for frost trolls.\n\nHe'll call you goat while he slits your throat\nThe dastardly butcher, Haefal.\nWhen the river thaws then it's down you'll float\nNever again seen in Morthal.\n\n—Children's skipping rhyme circa 2E 275\n\nThe disturbing details of the above excerpt point to the long winter of 2E 248. As many as a dozen families disappeared, which led to paranoia and worry among the survivors of Morthal. The missing Nords were never found, though their doors were left open almost as if someone came into their homes in the middle of the night and dragged them away.\n\nOur records from the period bear no mention of the name Haefal, or this mystery would be solved before it began. It's likely that name was attributed to the murders by the creator of the children's rhyme. \n\nMost scholars at the time, and my contemporaries today, assume that the missing villagers were the result of strategic Goblin attacks which were frequent during that winter. But, for a moment, let us consider that the Butcher of Morthal was real. Who was he?\n\nMorthal is not a large village, so it is unlikely that there was a formal butcher. More realistically, every family had experience butchering game animals. If there was one specialized craftsman, then it would be far easier to ascertain who the killer was. Or indeed if the killer was a skilled butcher at all. Still, there is a distinct possibility that butcher referred to the gruesome fate of the victims and not a profession at all. \n\nAs for temperament, he would have to be highly reactive. The children's rhymes suggest that the killer exacted revenge over a breach of the code of conduct: eating his sweetrolls. If this is the case, that something as small as a missing dessert would result in brutal murder, then the killer would have to be more than just protective of sweetrolls. The protection would be fanatical, almost religious. But a religious devotion to a delectable dessert is straying too far from the source material to be a feasible theory and so I will set it aside.\n\nIt may be worth noting that many sources about Butcher Haefal include references to goats. Perhaps this was a way of announcing his intent to his victims? There was a theory that multiple herds of goats also disappeared around this same year, though the records of herd sizes are more sparse than usual. I find that explanation difficult to believe, but for the sake of academic integrity, I resolved to include the information here.\n\nWith such a secretive and potentially fictionalized killer, it's difficult to tell when the deaths stopped. In truth, it's impossible to tell if the killer was ever actually caught. The other examples in this book have a more definitive resolution. Which is a boon for historians and the populace as a whole, but the Butcher of Morthal's legend has never fully died. \n\nIf you travel to Morthal and ask a village elder, they'll likely tell you who the Butcher was. They may even regale you with tales of how the Butcher haunted their nightmares as a child. Which just goes to show the hold that the Butcher has upon the people of Morthal. By existing in folklore and in popular memory, he never really died. The Butcher of Morthal can never truly be killed or defeated.
Removed: By Nardhil Arethan\n\nFew Daedra have ever been fully bound by the power of the paleonymic or any nymic, though famous examples do exist. This is because they rarely record their nymics anywhere or allow them to become known, either by mortals or by other Daedra. This extrapolation is added to the history of Archmagister Mavon Ules as evidenced by the recent discovery of Mysissa's pilfered notebooks. Direct quotes are taken from the source material, extrapolations are the product of the author.\n\nIn the year 2E 210 Magister Mavon Ules performed a spell of reportedly immense power which solidified his position as the archmagister for almost a decade before the title was stripped from him by Magister Varona Githrano. The spell summoned one of the lesser Daedra and bound it to Magister Mavon's service. Such spells were previously used to bind imps and scamps, but none had ever been attempted with Skaafin or similarly ranked Daedra. This is what made the now Archmagister Mavon's spell so unique and powerful. \n\nArchmagister Mavon notoriously kept few records. This makes him widely unpopular both to the magisters who lived at the time (and who wanted to steal his magical secrets for their own benefit) as well as among historians who seek to preserve the past via written accounts. The Skaafin, Mysissa, bound by his spell, on the other hand, was prolific and detailed in her hatred of Mavon. She detailed her life with Magister Mavon, though in reviewing the documents, there is nothing useful for other mages. Most of the many books Mysissa wrote contained the insults and threats expected of a Daedra in her situation. Though one passage does suggest how Archmagister Mavon completed the spell which trapped Mysissa. \n\n"If he'd won my name through trickery or guile like a truly regretful creature, then this would be fine. But no, he shunned Nycot and stumbled across it. The bafoonish mortal thinks he's some sort of mage-godling. Ha! There's more magic in a dog's tail! When he dies, I will call the bugs and crawlers of this realm to feast on his unworthy corpse."\n\nThe name that Mysissa refers to could be her paleonymic. If Archmagister Mavon somehow found a Daedra's paleonymic, then the origin of his Skaafin servant is less mysterious than previously thought. This also explains why Mysissa never wrote down any of Mavon's secrets, as it's likely that the spell binding her to his service forbade any direct sabotaging of his magical pursuits. Which is just as well for Mysissa, as this means there's no record of her paleonymic, nor of the ritual which bound her fully to Magister Mavon's service. \n\nMysissa's existence and binding to Magister Mavon where heretofore the subject of much speculation. Other magisters around for Archmagister Mavon's ascension noted that his magical power gained a significant and sudden boost while none among their number were impacted. He seemed more knowledgeable in the matters of Oblivion, to the point where some speculated that he made a pact with a Daedra of some sort. But no one guessed that he had a Skaafin assisting him or advising him. \n\nNow knowing what we do, with several tomes dedicated to elaborate plans to dispose of Archmagister Mavon, I suspect that Mysissa had a hand in Archmagister Mavon's downfall. Where previously it is thought that Magister Dubere Dilmyn infiltrated Mavon's tower under the promise of companionship and sharing a new alchemical ingredient, the current theory is that Mysissa distracted her master so that he never fully unlocked the door (murder plan number 534). \n\nAfter Archmagister Mavon's disappearance, for he did disappear—potentially eaten by the crawlers as Mysissa promised—not much is known of Mysissa or what happened to her. I suspect that after this time spent in Archmagister Mavon's service, that she quickly disposed of any evidence of her paleonymic and left this plane. Which would explain why we have no records of the spell or notes of Archmagister Mavon's contributions to spellcrafting of any sort. \n\nI would say that Archmagister Mavon's demise is a cautionary tale against using nymics to trap and control Daedra, but the true and factual matter of the documents found about Mysissa is that not enough is known. Still as Mysissa wrote, "do not meddle in affairs you cannot control. The power of names, less so."
Removed: In the year 2E 87 the Knights of the Silver Rose launched a perilous campaign against a Xivilai clan who sought to invade Borderwatch. While little is known about how they intercepted the Xivilai's plans or became aware of it, their methods were swift and effective. Accounts written by Collatinus Antias, a member of the order describe the Knight's assault tactics.\n\n"We stole through the night, creeping across the hills and through the grasses with stealth which surprised even our seasoned Knight commander. Our formations were well-organized, with nary a space for weakness or fault. When the battle finally commenced, our attack shocked the battle-hardened Daedra so much that their surprise allowed us the upper hand. We struck fiercely and true. After all these months of training, the battle took little longer than a night. The Xivilai are used to fighting as individuals, gaining their own glory through their battle skills. This was their eventual downfall since their lack of formation could find no bearing against our well-practiced tactics. We spent the following days giving praise and thanks to the mother of the Rose who saw us through the battle. In her name, we succeed. In her name, our lands are safe from corruption. And, in her name, we act. \n\nBlessed be Azura, who is the guiding strength behind our attack."

Removed: 2E 304, Abecean Sea.\n\nAt the rate at which my crew is shrinking, I doubt anything of our accursed and ill-fated voyage will survive beyond this record. Tu' whacca, give us the strength to avoid such a fate. \n\nFor all the days I neglected to write the happenings on my ship, I'll recount the major events.\n\nWe set sail from Summerset and headed east across the waters. A fierce wind kept our sails filled and our course calculations has us making landfall in Khefrem a week early. The crew rejoiced, for our time at sea was long and everyone was eager to sail in familiar waters once again. The sun was high, and no other sails or storms were visible from the crow's-nest. Everything was calm and idyllic. Tava looked upon us favorably. Or so we thought.\n\nWe awoke one morning to find ourselves trapped in the clear eye of a storm. A league on either side, was dark clouds and troubled seas. But we rested in windless pocket of clear skies and calm waters. At first, we thought it was a Sea Elf raid. The crew spent three nights armed and prepared for battle. They slept in shifts and got little rest at that. When no ships broke the storm clouds and no wind filled our sail, we thought of the Daedra and wondered if we somehow drew the attention of their frightful number. Still, with our stores emptying every day, we could not wait to starve. I ordered all rested hands to put oar to water. If the winds would not propel us to Stros M'kai, we would do it ourselves. That was my mistake.\n\nThe moment the first oar breached the still ocean waters the sea grew violent. It rippled and roiled with the bodies of a hundred sea adders. Their thick serpentine bodies lashed out and leaped onto the deck. Those with oars in the hands suffered the greatest, for the oars were too long to be used in combat. And those below deck, resting after their shifts of watching for Sea Elves had little time to gather themselves before the adders found the stairs. Somehow, we managed to slay the adders, but it was with heavy losses. The waters were still once more, and the boson ordered a day of rest to tend to and care for those who remained on this side of the Far Shores.\n\nThe night was filled with the song of pain from below deck and rest was sparse. Still, the morning broke with clouded skies and a great cheer arose. The sun rose in the sky and the winds rose with it. Finally, the doldrums we were caught in dissipated and the sails dragged what remained of my battered crew from those accursed waters.\n\nI thought that would be the end of our troubles, but while the wind returned, the storms did not dissipate. We sailed into their midst and, with a sizably smaller crew, we set out to battle the worst squall I have been unlucky enough to see. \n\nTwo experienced sailors pushed overboard by the arms of imps who careened out from the clouds. We lost their cries below the waves as we struggled to defend ourselves against tempest and imp. The call to arms erupted from all sides as the imps fell on us and my daring crew protected their stations and somehow kept the ship to rights before the imps fell back. \n\nWe cheered and cursed the clouds around us with equal fervor, doing our best to concentrate on battling the winds and not look about for more attackers. None came, that we saw, but the storm had worse for us in mind. When we least expected it, the lightning fell. Circular and swirling, unlike any I ever encountered. The crew let out a horrid cry as they saw great, hulking figures before us. Creatures of stone and storm who hurled tremendous energy at our vessel. \n\nStill, we had no way to avoid them. My ship was quick, but she can't outrun the wind. Her deck is sleek, but she can't turn from lightning. We fought to keep her from tearing herself apart, there was nothing more we could do. And so, my brave crew, half of the sailors who remained, stood at their posts and performed their duties until such time as the lightning drained the life from their arms. \n\nI was the worst captain in seas. In two days, I'd lost over half of my crew to unforeseen creatures. Each time we were attacked, I rushed to defend my crew, and each time I could do nothing. I do not know how we escaped the atronachs. I could not tell you where we sailed nor how. It was luck alone. Tu'whacca blessed their passing and cursed ours for our journey is not yet over.\n\nThe distance between our ship and the safety of Summerset feels insurmountable. Our journey is doomed by the sea and the sky. Enemies spring from the waters we must travel and even now my beloved crew succumbs to the pain of the past few days. \n\nI know not how these accounts of our sorry may be remembered, but I know they will survive us. If, by some blessing from the gods, we survive. I will renounce the waters I once loved. They have turned against me. May Tava see us home or end us quickly.
Removed: By the order of Knightmaster Alyxe Justal and the edict of 1E 2907, we are hereby mandated to clear the Windweaper's Grove of all forms of wildlife both violent and benevolent. \n\nFrom this day forth, no sort of tree-life, lurchers, Graft-root beings, insects, or squirrels will stifle our site of construction. For that is the cause of this edict. Where the Windweaper's grove now stands, is being consigned to the flow of progress and civilization. Knightmaster Alyxe Justal commissioned the construction of a temple of Arkay, in honor of the sacred grove protected by the spriggans, currently in residence there, as well as new barracks for the ever-growing militia protecting our great town.\n\nIn the name of Zenithar, may our work be productive and our toil not without merit.\nMay Arkay accept our temple, constructed in his name. \nAnd, most importantly, may Akatosh allow our work to pass quickly.
Removed: In sorting through my thoughts regarding the Knights of the Silver Rose and all that transpired that day, I came to one sorry revelation: that anyone, no matter how upstanding, can fall to the shadows beyond Azura.\n\nI do not want to believe what my eyes saw. I do not want to acknowledge that the knights I so admired could become those fiends. I do not want to say that the knights who strived to protect would turn on those they guarded. But all these things are true. \n\nWhether those creatures who once stood as a safeguard against Oblivion retained a fragment of their uncorrupted selves is beyond my understanding. I hope not. I hope they didn't have a small voice screaming inside them that this was wrong. I hope that whatever part of Oblivion changed them took the last vestiges of memory from their minds. They certainly acted like it had. \n\nLet what occurred be a sign to all who seek to contain the wonders of Oblivion. It is a force that cannot be corralled by mortals. \n\nI will pray to Azura at dusk and ask her to protect us from the magics of Oblivion. Maybe one as powerful as a Daedric Prince can better stand against the fate I have seen.\n\nWeylin
Removed: As written by Girara the Undying\n\nDepending on your magical experience and talent, there are different classifications regarding materials a novice necromancer must work with. In order to raise your own army and conquer your enemies, you must first understand these materials. After all, it is a rule of magic that no one can fully control that which they do not understand. \n\nGhosts\nMagic is a fickle thing, not tied to many of the physical restrictions of this world. Because of this, it is often easiest for novices to command a similarly incorporeal material at the start of their studies. The spirits of the dead exist throughout Tamriel, though they do not always have the energy to visibly manifest. Here, the necromantic arts present their clear and obvious uses. Simply concentrate your power in a location and the odds are good a ghost will take form. \n\nSkeletons\nAs the basic soldiers in any competent necromancer's army, skeletons are little more than a structure held together by magic. Little effort is needed in order to raise these corporeal undead, and the requisite bones can be carried in a bag until they are needed.\n\nZombies\nSkeletons are simple creatures, easy to conjure and command. Zombies are an entirely different matter. Flesh retains the memories of its old self and must be made to forget before they can be raised and controlled. Rituals and rites, as well as a change in scenery, help confuse the flesh and strip it of its former identity. If done successfully, the corpse of your choosing will achieve a sort of stasis and do your bidding with ease. \n\nWraiths\nUnlike the other manifestations, wraiths are spirits governed by strong emotions. In order to call forth and command a wraith, you must learn how to twist a spirit into its darkest expression. Allow the anger and rage of a life cut short to govern the spirit's form as you summon it. Master raising the dead, and you will command them with ease.\n\nLiches\nYou cannot control a lich. Do not even attempt to command one through magic. Liches have used necromancy to ascend to a state of undeath and are definitely more powerful than you. They are masters of the dark rituals, necromancers of the highest order.
